# PasswordGen
A script that generates passwords using python

**DO NOT USE THIS TO GENERATE REAL PASSWORDS**  

I am using the random library for generating passwords which is a pseudo-random number generator, if you use this to generate your passwords it is possible for people to guess them with realtive ease.
